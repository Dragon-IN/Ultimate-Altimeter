Ultimate Altimeter Users Manual

1. Battery and Charging
    A. The battery of the Ultimate Altimeter is a 40 mAh, Lithium Polymer (or LiPo) battery. It should last around 1 hour during normal use, last about 6 hours in Standby mode (see 2. B.), and should charge in around 30 minutes using the provided Mini-USB to JST charger. When not in use for long periods of time, store the battery at around half charge to keep it in good condition.
    B. Due to the fragile nature of the battery's short wires (between the white JST connector and the rest of the battery), it is recommended that the JST connector never be fully inserted into the Mini-USB to JST charger. If it is fully inserted, it can be difficult to remove because of the tightness of the JST connectors on the battery and charger. In the event of this happening, use pliers or a similar tool to safely remove the JST connector. DO NOT pull on the battery's wires. The battery is charging if a red light is on on the charger. When the red light turns off, the battery is done charging. 
    C. If a battery breaks, is lost, or becomes unusable for any other reason, an extra can be purchased at this link: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11316
2. Operating Instructions
    A. The a Ultimate Altimeter has different modes with different functions. 
         I. "Alt" (Altitude mode) - Shows the current altitude.
         II. "HiGH" (High mode) - Shows the highest altitude that the altimeter has been. 
         III. "Lo" (Low mode) - Shows the lowest the altimeter has been.
         IV. "diFF" (Difference mode) - Shows the altitude you have covered ("High" - "Low").
         V. "Stby" (Standby mode) - Turns the display off to save power. This mode could be used for a longer activity such as hiking where saving power is more important. It is not needed for RC Airplane flights because of their short duration.
    B. Input Mechanisms
         I. The button on the back of the Ultimate Altimeter is used to change modes. Press it once to cycle through to the next mode. 
         II. The switch on the Ultimate Altimeter turns it on and off.
